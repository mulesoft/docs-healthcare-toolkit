:keywords: hl7, hapi, message object, delete, segment

Working with instances of HAPI message objects, this component deletes a segment from an HL7 message. If your HL7 message is not a HAPI message object, you must use the xref:hl7-encoding-transformer.adoc[HL7 Encoding Transformer] to convert it before it passes through the Delete Segment component.

[NOTE]
This component is part of the xref:index.adoc[Mule Healthcare Toolkit], which includes transformers, components and connectors for receiving, processing and sending HL7 messages. For details and a full list of available tools, consult the Toolkit's  xref:index.adoc[documentation main page].

== HAPI Object

If the HL7 message that you wish to modify is not a HAPI object, transform it to a HAPI object with the xref:hl7-encoding-transformer.adoc[HL7 Encoding Transformer], which you can place immediately before the Delete Segment component.
