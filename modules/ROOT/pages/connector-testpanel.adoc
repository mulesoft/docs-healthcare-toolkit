TestPanel is an HL7 receiver, transmitter, and message editor. TestPanel is free software distributed under the http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/license.html[MPL/GPL] licenses, and runs on Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows.

Because the TestPanel can transmit HL7 messages to a listening application through MLLP or HTTP, you can use it to test your Mule flows that handle HL7. The following section provides an example of a simple flow tested with the TestPanel.

*Sample Application:* https://docs.mulesoft.com/downloads/healthcare-toolkit/3.0/hl7-edi-demo-app.zip[HL7 EDI MLLP Demo Application (zip file)]

== Simple Example

In this example, you can:

* Build a simple Studio application to process the HL7 messages, then send responses
* Configure the TestPanel application to send and receive HL7 messages on specific ports
* Test that the setup works as intended

== Configuration and Illustration

The TestPanel uses the following default Host and Port configurations:

* To send and receive a HL7 messages – localhost, port 50609

The diagram below illustrates the steps that TestPanel and Mule take to process HL7 messages.

The TestPanel:

. Generates an HL7 message.
. Sends an HL7 message to the Mule application over port 50609.
. Receives an HL7 message.
. Mule App processes the HL7 message.
. Sends an ACK reply (general acknowledge) to localhost port 50609, and Mule stores the message on a file on the local filesystem at the same time.
. Receives the ACK reply.

== Anypoint Studio Application

This example application performs the following actions:

* Listens for incoming HL7 messages.
* After it receives a message through HL7 MLLP, HL7 EDI reads/validates a message and generates an HL7 ACK message.
* HL7 EDI writes the ACK message in HL7 ER7 format, and HL7 MLLP sends it back to the sending application.
* File Connector stores the ACK message on a file.

The first building block is an xref:mllp-connector.adoc[HL7 inbound endpoint], configured with the following parameters:

* *Host*: `localhost`
* *Port*: `50609`

After the HL7 MLLP inbound endpoint, an xref:3.8@mule-runtime::all-flow-control-reference.adoc[All Flow Control] sends the HL7 message to two xref:3.8@mule-runtime::cache-scope.adoc[Cache Scopes] for parallel processing.

In the *Process the HL7 Message* scope, xref:hl7-edi.adoc[HL7 EDI] reads and validates the original HL7 message and generates an ACK message.
** In this demo, HL7 EDI is configured to process ADT_A01 in HL7 v2.5.1 (/hl7/v2_5_1/ADT_A01.esl). You can add other versions and messages schemas in the HL7 Message character encoding under the HL7 EDI: Configuration.

In the *Send a HL7 ACK* scope, HL7 MLLP sends the ACK message to the originating application.

=== TestPanel Configuration

This section explains how to set up TestPanel to work with this example.

TestPanel configuration involves the following tasks:

* Configuring the TestPanel to send a sample HL7 message to localhost port 50609
* Starting the listening port
* Sending a sample HL7 message
* Checking the Activity log for the ACK reply from Mule

To configure the TestPanel:

. In the *Sending Connections* pane to the right of HAPI TestPanel's main window, click the displayed `localhost` connection (see the mouse cursor in the image below).

+
. At the *Outgoing Message Sender *pane, configure the following settings (highlighted above):
** *Host*: `localhost`
** *Port*: `50609`
. Click  *Start*  near the top of the *Incoming Message Receiver* pane. The TestPanel  starts listening for HL7 messages on the configured host and port.
. Click the *Messages* pane to the right of the application window. The application displays a predefined sample HL7 message (see image below).
+

+
. Click the *Send* button near the top of the pane. The application sends the sample message once to the specified host and port. Mule receives the HL7 message, then returns an ACK message to the TestPanel.
. Check the *Activity* log for the HL7 response from Mule. The image below displays the HL7 ACK messages sent by Mule.
