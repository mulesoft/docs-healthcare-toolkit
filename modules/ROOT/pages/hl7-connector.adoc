:keywords: 1.3, hl7 connector

You can create and configure an HL7 Connector as a https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/global-elements[Global Element] that the connectors in your flow reference. an HL7 connector configured as a global element defines connection parameters for all HL7 connections that reference the connector.

[TIP]
The HL7 connector is part of the xref:index.adoc[Mule Healthcare Toolkit], which also includes transformers and components for receiving, processing, and sending HL7 messages. For details and a full list of available tools, consult the Toolkit's xref:index.adoc[documentation main page].

== Configuration

To create an HL7 global connector, complete the following steps:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab under the canvas, then click *Create*.

. At the *Choose Global Type* window, type `h17` into the *Filter* input field to display only HL-7 related global types.

. Under *Connectors*, click *HL7 Connector*, then click *OK*.

Studio displays the *Global Element Properties* window, where you configure the global connector.

The following subsections describe the connector's configuration parameters for configuration in Studio and Mule Runtime.

|Name |Type/Allowed |Required |Default |Description
|`hl7Encoding` a|

* `ER7`
