:keywords: hl7, global, connector

You can create and configure an HL7 Connector as a xref:3.8@mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Element] which the connectors in your flow will reference. An HL7 connector configured as a global element defines connection parameters for all HL7 connections that reference the connector.

*Release Notes*: xref:release-notes::connector/hl7-connector-release-notes.adoc[HL7 Connector Release Notes]

[NOTE]
The HL7 connector is part of the xref:index.adoc[Mule Healthcare Toolkit], which also includes transformers and components for receiving, processing and sending HL7 messages. For details and a full list of available tools, consult the Toolkit's xref:index.adoc[documentation main page].

<<Configuration For Studio and Mule Runtime>>

== Configuration

To create an HL7 global connector, complete the following steps:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab under the canvas, then click *Create*.
. At the *Choose Global Type* window, type `hl7` into the *Filter* input field to display only HL7-related global types.
. Under *Connectors*, click *HL7 Connector*, then click *OK*.

Studio displays the *Global Element Properties* window, where you configure the global connector.

The following subsections describe the connector's configuration parameters for configuration in Studio and Mule Runtime.
