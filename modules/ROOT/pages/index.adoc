Healthcare Toolkit is a collection of features that facilitates integration with healthcare systems by providing the tools needed to easily create, read, and transform HL7 messages within Mule.

This document assumes a working knowledge of Mule and Anypoint Studio (Studio).

== Overview

Health Level Seven International is a standards development organization that defines a set of standards for the transport and communication of healthcare information.

The version of MuleSoft's HL7 connector is different from the HL7 version numbering. The HL7 connector supports HL7 software versions v2.1, v2.2, v2.3.1, v2.3, v2.4, v2.5, v2.5.1, v2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8, and 2.8.1.

Healthcare Toolkit allows you to send and receive HL7 messages in ER7 format over MLLP and other transport protocols and corresponding connectors supported by Mule, such as HTTP. Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) uses the HL7 MLLP connector.

This page describes the functionality included in Healthcare Toolkit, and provides installation instructions.
